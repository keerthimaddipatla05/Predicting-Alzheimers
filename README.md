The dataset consists of a single table containing information on 74,283 elderly individuals from 20 different countries across all continents except Antarctica. The participants range in age from 50 to their late 90s. Some of the countries represented include Spain, China, the UK, the USA, Japan, South Africa, and Brazil.


**Research Questions:**

1. How do age, education level, and lifestyle factors (such as physical activity, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption) affect the chance of developing Alzheimer's?
2. What is the relationship between coexisting conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and BMI) and Alzheimer’s prevalence? Do these factors change based on gender?
3. How do regional differences in lifestyle factors and medical conditions relate to the prevalence of Alzheimer’s?

The questions are answered within the two notebooks.
